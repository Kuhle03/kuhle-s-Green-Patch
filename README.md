Goal and Aim 

Kuhle’s Dairy Patch aims to connect with customers online by creating a simple, easy-to
use website to showcase our dairy products and services. Our goal is to make it easier for 
customers to learn about our products, place orders, and connect with us. 

2. Objectives 

Build a customers-friendly subscription system allowing users to pause, change ,cancel 
weekly milk deliveries with ease. Introduce a secure and efficient e-commerce checkout 
compatible with major payment method however the farm’s ethical and sustainable 
farming methods to inspire customers loyalty and trust. 

3. Current Analysis  Currently, Kuhles’s Dairy Patch relies on word-of-mouth and local 

sales. We do not have an online presence, which limits our ability to reach a wider 
audience. Customers often have to visit physically to inquire about products. By creating 
a website, we can reach more people, provide up-to-date information, and improve 
customer convenience. 
Problem : many customers lack access to fresh, ethically sourced dairy and they are far 
from where their food comes from while supermarkets are convenient , they offer little 
insight into the quality and origin of their products.  
Target audience: Everyone  who likes fresh dairy products. Children and Adults , 
health- conscious families , supermarkets and small shops.

4. Proposed Website Features and Functionality - Homepage with brand story and featured products - Products page with descriptions and prices - Contact page with form and location - Blog for updates and tips - Mobile-friendly design 

5. Design Aesthetic 
The design will be clean, fresh, and inspired by dairy farm life. Soft white and green 
tones will be used to reflect freshness and nature. 
Style: Rustic-minimalist (warm farm feel and clean modern layout) 
Colors: Creamy white ,earthy brown , sage green 
Fonts: playfair display (heading), inter( body text)
